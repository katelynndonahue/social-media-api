# social-media-api
As a social media startup I want an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database so that my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data. This project helped me to better understand the syntax, CRUD operations and Insomnia.

## Installation

I began by creating a uniquely named repository on GitHub and cloned the SSH key to work locally. I then took the starter code and began to flesh out my initial file and folder setup. From there, I utilized the previous lessons to build the code, created my user and thought controllers, models, and routes. I used Insomnia to perform the CRUD operations.

## Usage

    ```md
